Conclusion \n\nSummary: New Zealand is facing a housing crisis that has persisted for years and has proven challenging for successive governments to address. The issue is particularly significant because most New Zealanders own a home and over half of household wealth consists of land and property. Contributing factors to the crisis include a lack of affordable housing, a rise in demand due to population growth and investment by foreign buyers. The absence of a capital-gains tax has allowed money made on property sales to go untaxed, further exacerbating the issue. Proposals to address the crisis include increasing the supply of affordable homes, implementing a capital-gains tax, and restrictions on foreign buyers.
