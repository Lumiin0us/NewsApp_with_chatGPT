Col. Richard Hecht, a spokesman for the Israeli military. That prompted the Israeli forces to deploy helicopter gunships in support of ground troops battling the militants, he said.", "At least one powerful explosive device laid by Palestinian militants and other fire disabled several Israeli armored vehicles in a village near Jenin at around 7 a.m. on Monday, complicating what had started out as an arrest raid, the military said.", "The Israeli forces then called in\u00a0Apache combat helicopters that fired toward Palestinian gunmen to try to clear the zone as additional forces worked under fire to extricate the damaged vehicles, the military said. Experts said that was probably the first such use of helicopter gunships in the occupied West Bank since the second Palestinian uprising about 20 years ago.", "Colonel Hecht said that the helicopter had fired at open areas to keep the Palestinian gunmen at a distance and that the army\u2019s evacuation efforts were continuing amid exchanges of fire more than five hours after the vehicles were hit. The troops eventually left the area at about 2.30 p.m., according to military officials.", "The pre-dawn raid began as a routine operation to arrest the two Palestinian suspects, immediately setting off heavy clashes between the Israeli forces and gunmen in the area, the military said. Explosive devices were hurled at the forces who responded with live fire, resulting in casualties, it added.", "The militant group Islamic Jihad said that two of the people killed were its members.", "As the Israeli forces were heading out of Jenin, a powerful roadside bomb exploded, targeting the vulnerable underside of a Panther armored vehicle, Colonel Hecht said, in a scene that some Israeli analysts described as reminiscent of the monthlong war that Israel fought in southern Lebanon in 2006 against the Iranian-backed militant organization Hezbollah.", "A statement from a local branch of the military wing of the Islamist militant group Hamas, based in the Jenin refugee camp, praised the Palestinian fighters for being able \u201cto ambush a Zionist force\u201d in the camp.

Israeli military raids have increased over the last year along with the rise of local, armed Palestinian groups that have carried out shooting attacks against Israelis in the West Bank and that generally act independently of the established and more disciplined Palestinian organizations.", "About 130 Palestinians have been killed this year, many of them\u00a0during gun battles between the Israeli Army and armed Palestinian groups, but also civilians caught in the crossfire.

Her trip is aimed at, among other things, trying to expand Israel\u2019s relations with Arab states \u2014 a mission that would appear to be complicated by the prospect of more settlement activity in the West Bank.", "Most countries consider Jewish settlements in the occupied territories that Israel captured from Jordan in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 to be in violation of international law. The Biden administration, like most previous American administrations, has repeatedly condemned construction in settlements, considering it a source of increased tensions with Palestinians and a hindrance to the prospects of any permanent peace based on the two-state solution because they undermine the future establishment of an independent Palestinian state in those territories.", "Later Sunday, the United States State Department sharply criticized the Israeli government\u2019s decision to accelerate the authorization process for settlement construction and its plans for thousands of additional housing units, saying it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the actions.", "\u201cAs has been longstanding policy, the United States opposes such unilateral actions that make a two-state solution more difficult to achieve and are an obstacle to peace,\u201d Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, said in a statement.", "The change agreed to on Sunday is an amendment to planning procedures that have been in place since 1996. The amendment removes the need for high-level political approval at various interim stages of the planning process, making it harder for the prime minister and defense minister to slow or pause new settlement construction for diplomatic or security reasons and generally allowing for accelerated expansion.", "Government officials said that the change would cut unnecessary red tape in the approval process and that new construction would still be subject to final authorization by the prime minister.", "The altered rules specify that the responsibility for approvals will be transferred to Mr. Smotrich for the duration of the current government and will apply to any government that appoints an additional minister to serve in the Defense Ministry.", "The Trump administration reversed decades of American policy in 2019 by declaring that the United States did not consider West Bank settlements to be in violation of international law. But the Biden administration has called on Israel to rein in construction in the occupied territories, and Palestinians have demanded the land for a future state, a goal that has long been backed by the United Nations, European governments and American allies across the Middle East.", "The planning change illustrates a balance that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is trying to strike between the demands of his ultranationalist coalition partners and his stated goal of normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia. Though Saudi Arabia is no longer demanding the establishment of a Palestinian state as a condition for establishing open diplomatic ties with Israel, vast settlement expansion is unlikely to help.", "Mr. Smotrich\u00a0commented on the changes to the planning process in a post on Twitter.\u00a0\u201cThe construction boom in Judea and Samaria and all over our country continues,\u201d he wrote, referring to the West Bank by biblical names.", "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we will continue to expand settlement and strengthen Israel\u2019s hold on the territory,\u201d he added.", "Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy group that opposes settlements and tracks their progress, said in a statement that the Netanyahu government was empowering \u201ca dangerous minority driven by messianic ideals\u201d by handing the approval power to Mr. Smotrich, leader of the hard-right Religious Zionism party.", "\u201cThis decision will inevitably lead to further harmful construction in the settlements, in clear violation of international law,\u201d Peace Now added, saying that the government was on a \u201cpath toward de facto annexation.\u201d", "In response to the Israeli move, a top Palestinian official, Hussein al-Sheikh, said that the Palestinian leadership had decided to boycott a Monday meeting of the Joint Economic Committee,\u00a0which regulates economic relations between the two sides. He said that the Palestinian leadership would \u201cexamine a number of other measures\u201d to further protest the planning amendment.", "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jordan also condemned the Israeli government\u2019s decision.

Black people, in this telling, could be proud of their roots in the ancient kingdom that built some of the world\u2019s greatest splendors.", "But for Egyptians, it all adds up to a wounded sense that, just as Westerners plundered antiquities like the Rosetta Stone from Egypt and hogged the credit for discovering them in centuries past, they are once again seizing control of ancient Egypt from Egyptians themselves.", "The museum exhibit, \u201cKemet: Egypt in Hip-Hop, Jazz, Soul & Funk,\u201d looks at how Afrocentrism has played out in music.

It\u2019s a question that has acquired greater immediacy since it was posed in 1998 by Jimmy Carter\u2019s former national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski: \u201cWhat is more important in the history of the world?\u201d he said. \u201cSome stirred-up Islamists or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?\u201d", "That comment appeared in an interview with the French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur. Asked whether he regretted sending covert U.S. aid to Afghanistan in 1979, all but ensuring the Soviet invasion and the subsequent rise of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Brzezinski demurred. \u201cDrawing the Russians into the Afghan trap,\u201d he replied, had been \u201can excellent idea.\u201d", "In 1983, a few years into the Russian invasion, a 30-year-old Vickers left an early career as a Green Beret to join the C.I.A. The Cold War of the 1980s was mostly quite cold; covert operations promised action. At the agency, Vickers rose fast. Before the end of the decade, the young operative had become an architect of the Russian defeat in Afghanistan. This was, he writes, the \u201cdecisive battle\u201d in the struggle that brought \u201can end to the Soviet Empire.\u201d", "After a stretch of graduate education and a turn at a Washington think tank, Vickers earned a new job, this time at the Pentagon.

Yet it was Afghanistan, occupied by U.S. forces beginning in 2001, that once more became the focal point of his attention.", "In America\u2019s very long confrontation with stirred-up Islamists, Vickers became the nation\u2019s pre-eminent silent warrior. He brought to the science of war the same qualities that Ted Williams brought to the science of hitting a baseball: preternatural aptitude coupled with a relentless determination to master his craft.", "The combination can cause myopia. In Vickers\u2019s case, it manifested as a lack of appreciation for war\u2019s political dimensions.

In the winter of 1989, the Russian military withdrew. Three years later, the Kremlin-installed government in Kabul collapsed. Washington lost interest in Afghanistan and Vickers retreated into studies of Thucydides and Sun Tzu. The Afghans, meanwhile, claimed the fruits of their victory: anarchy and civil war leading to draconian rule by the Taliban.", "The events of 9/11 prompted senior members of the George W.
