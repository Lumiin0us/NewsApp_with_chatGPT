[{"asia_1": ["An austere greeting on the airport tarmac in Beijing sans a red carpet. A stone-faced handshake from China\u2019s top foreign policy official. A seat looking up at the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, perched at the head of a long table.", "To international audiences, the optics of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken\u2019s two-day visit to Beijing barely raised any eyebrows. Foreign ministers are rarely, if ever, met with much fanfare at the airport. And an audience with a head of state alone is a sign of great importance and respect.", "But to nationalist-leaning audiences in China, especially on social media, the scenes tell a different story. To them, Mr. Blinken arrived only after months of pleading for an invitation. And during his visit, he was schooled on respecting China\u2019s interests and played supplicant to Mr. Xi. Chinese social media users gleefully noted that Mr. Blinken arrived on Father\u2019s Day, the implication being \u2014 using the parlance of the internet \u2014 that Mr. Xi was America\u2019s daddy.", "The nationalistic commentary in China around Mr. Blinken\u2019s visit underscored a point that Mr. Xi made in his meeting with the top American diplomat on Monday: \u201cMajor-country competition does not represent the trend of the times.\u201d The translation: Surrounding China with security partners and cutting off its access to advanced technology is not healthy competition, but an invitation for conflict.", "Mr. Xi\u2019s rejection of the framing of U.S.-China relations by the two most recent American presidents raises doubts about whether the world\u2019s two superpowers can reach a strategic accommodation with each other in the coming years.", "\u201cThey apparently don\u2019t buy into this framework at all,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ", "\u201cThat begs the question: Is it then possible to stabilize relations?\u201d", "It is unclear to what extent the state played a role in promoting the triumphant narrative online, though Chinese censors generally have broad controls to sway public opinion. Even in China\u2019s more staid state-controlled news outlets, which mostly carried the government\u2019s summaries of the meetings, coverage of the visit emphasized Beijing\u2019s view that Mr. Blinken was visiting to reassure the Chinese government and listen to its concerns. ", "Casting China as a strong and responsible power willing to lower tensions with a belligerent United States may help mask the less politically palatable reasons Beijing wants to re-engage with Washington, analysts say. Chief among them is the need to stabilize the Chinese economy, which has been struggling to maintain a recovery after coming out of three years of punishing pandemic restrictions.", "\u201cThe optics of Xi Jinping lecturing to a subordinate American secretary of state from the head of a boardroom table plays well to a domestic audience that China is a global power that not only demands, but receives, respect from other great powers,\u201d said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.", "He noted that Mr. Blinken\u2019s two immediate predecessors \u2014 Mike Pompeo and Rex W. Tillerson \u2014 were seated next to Mr. Xi in armchairs when they met. (Mr. Xi sat with Mr. Pompeo in Beijing in June 2018, but did not meet the U.S. secretary when he returned that October.) Others pointed out that Bill Gates was invited to sit down next to a smiling Mr. Xi in an ornate wooden chair last week.", "American officials say Mr. Blinken\u2019s trip was necessary because maintaining regular high-level diplomacy between the world\u2019s two superpower rivals \u2014 and its two largest economies and militaries \u2014 is critical to avoiding open conflict. Not only do the two governments seek stability in the relationship, but so do their allies and other nations. And diplomacy allows the two sides to make their views clear in private and public talks.", "\u201cIf you want to stand up for American values on human rights and if you want to free detained Americans here or enlist China\u2019s help on the fentanyl crisis, you can\u2019t do it from the sidelines,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cYou need to talk to them and press them as Secretary Blinken did on his visit here. You don\u2019t give anything away by talking.\u201d", "\u201cThe Chinese received the secretary with a great deal of dignity,\u201d added Mr. Burns, who was in all of Mr. Blinken\u2019s meetings. \u201cPresident Xi Jinping was very courteous in the meeting.\u201d", "Chinese officials, keen to turn the focus to commerce as an anchor in U.S.-China relations, had pushed for Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, and Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, to visit first, but American officials insisted that Mr. Blinken had to precede them. Now those other two U.S. cabinet officials are expected to travel to Beijing this summer, as is John Kerry, the climate envoy.", "Analysts say China hopes the talks can help bolster business confidence when many of the traditional levers of Chinese economic growth, such as real estate, are facing dramatic challenges.", "Moreover, China wants to underscore to the Biden administration its opposition to trade restrictions that choke Chinese access to important technologies, such as advanced semiconductor chips. ", "\u201cXi\u2019s main motivation in entertaining the Americans is because the Chinese economy is in a really bad state,\u201d said Willy Lam, an analyst of Chinese politics who is a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a research institute in Washington. \u201cExports are down noticeably, and more U.S. and Western firms are moving production bases away from China.\u201d", "In hosting Mr. Blinken, China also sought to lay the groundwork for Mr. Xi to visit the United States in November for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit \u2014 a trip that could lead to a one-on-one meeting with President Biden, the kind of visit would help burnish Mr. Xi\u2019s image as a global statesman.", "Beijing may also be moved by a sense of urgency to press the Biden administration for more assurances that it won\u2019t inflame pro-independence sentiment in Taiwan, especially ahead of presidential elections in both the United States and Taiwan next year. In both places, politicians have ramped up rhetoric critical of the Chinese Communist Party during campaign years because they think that helps win votes.", "China has been furious over the Biden administration\u2019s growing support for the democratic, self-governed island \u2014 including a new trade agreement, more weapons sales and increased exchanges between officials. The Blinken visit gave China an opportunity to signal that it has warned the United States not to provoke Beijing over what its leaders have called the \u201ccore of China\u2019s core interests.\u201d", "While Mr. Blinken\u2019s visit may have helped end the freeze in top-level bilateral diplomacy, it also highlighted the fact that important dialogue between the two nations remains imperiled by China\u2019s attitude over Taiwan and the widening military and economic rivalry.", "After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last August, Beijing froze formal interactions with Washington on military issues, climate change and narcotics. China has only agreed to restore talks on climate change. U.S. officials went into the meetings in Beijing hoping to get China to reopen direct channels of military-to-military communications, including ones between the U.S. defense secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Indo-Pacific Command and their Chinese counterparts.", "Chinese officials meeting with Mr. Blinken rejected the request.", "Olivia Wang contributed reporting."]}, {"asia_2": ["In late March, Daniel Zhang unveiled what was called the \u201cmost significant\u201d overhaul in the 24-year history of Alibaba, one of China\u2019s original technology conglomerates, splitting the company into six units that would help them seek out investors from the public.", "Now, Mr. Zhang, the tech giant\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is out of the top job and will step down from Alibaba\u2019s board of directors, and two of the company\u2019s co-founders have moved up into the leadership positions.", "Alibaba announced on Tuesday that Mr. Zhang, 51, will relinquish his top job in September. Instead, he will serve only as chief executive of Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing division, a position he assumed in March when he unveiled the restructuring. Alibaba announced plans to spin off its cloud division in May, in preparation for a public listing.", "Joseph Tsai, 59, an Alibaba veteran with roots to the company\u2019s founding, will move up from executive vice chairman to chairman. Another Alibaba co-founder, Eddie Yongming Wu, will succeed Mr. Zhang as chief executive.", "\u201cThis is like the oldest of the old guard,\u201d said Duncan Clark, the chairman of the investment advisory firm BDA China in Beijing. \u201cThe trusted team, the old guard, is back in control.\u201d", "Alibaba is reshuffling its leadership at a critical time. The company was the highest-profile target of a crackdown by Beijing on the power of China\u2019s biggest tech companies. Its stock price has tumbled from its 2020 peak.", "Alibaba\u2019s founder, the billionaire Jack Ma, was driven out of the public eye in 2020 after criticizing Chinese regulators for stifling innovation at Ant Group, Alibaba\u2019s financial technology sister company. After his remarks, Chinese officials suspended plans for Ant Group to sell stock in an initial public offering. In 2021 Chinese antitrust regulators fined Alibaba $2.8 billion for preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms.", "Mr. Ma, a popular figure in China and long the face of the company, made a publicized return to China this year just as Alibaba announced its restructuring, which was seen in part as a response to tighter regulations by Beijing.", "On Saturday, Mr. Ma appeared at a math competition sponsored by a research division of Alibaba, according to a post on the institute\u2019s blog.\u00a0Though he no longer holds a formal role at Alibaba, Mr. Ma remains one of its largest shareholders, with 4.5 percent of the company as of 2021, according to corporate filings.", "In a letter to employees Tuesday, Mr. Zhang said it was time for him to dedicate his \u201cfull attention\u201d to the spinoff plans. He also cited the need for a clear separation between his roles at Alibaba and the cloud division.", "Mr. Tsai, the new chairman, has a relationship to Mr. Ma that some former employees have described as inseparable. The two met in 1999, when Alibaba was still a free online portal, and Mr. Tsai joined the company that year. He helped Mr. Ma secure early investments from Goldman Sachs and SoftBank, and stewarded the company\u2019s initial public offering in New York in 2014, then the largest in history.", "Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman since 2013, Mr. Tsai is the primary owner of the Brooklyn Nets, the National Basketball Association team.", "The elevation of Mr. Wu, a longtime executive of Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce division, signaled to analysts that Alibaba would continued to make online shopping a core pillar of its business.", "Mr. Wu, who is in his late 40s, helped lead Alibaba\u2019s transformation from an e-commerce giant to a mobile juggernaut, turning the digital payment app Alipay into one of the default forms of payment across China. He will continue to serve as the chairman of Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s two domestic e-commerce businesses.", "Mr. Zhang told investors that Alibaba would become less centralized and more efficient by spinning off its components. But Alibaba has also recently announced the creation of a high-level committee\u00a0to make decisions about distributing money to the new business groups, which some analysts took as a sign that the company was still keeping power in the hands of a few key people.", "Mr. Zhang succeeded Mr. Ma as chairman of Alibaba in 2019. Then a rising star in the company, he was the architect behind Singles Day, Alibaba\u2019s most successful shopping event. Known for his attention to detail and problem-solving abilities, Mr. Zhang was widely regarded as a complement to Mr. Ma, who was known inside the company for his visionary prowess.", "Alibaba is synonymous with online shopping in China. But the company has since expanded into an array of businesses from digital payments to delivery services to entertainment. In recent years, it has expanded its e-commerce division and has served the A.I. boom with its cloud computing unit.", "Jacob Cooke, chief executive of WPIC, an e-commerce consultancy, said the return of Mr. Tsai, who has extensive investments around the world, was a logical choice for Alibaba given its recent international focus.", "Last year, Alibaba poured $1.6 billion into its e-commerce business in Southeast Asia, according to corporate records in Singapore provided by VentureCap Insights, a research firm. And last week, it announced plans to start a local version of its e-commerce division, Tmall, in Europe."]}, {"asia_3": ["China\u2019s central bank cut key interest rates on Tuesday for loans issued by the state-controlled banking system, in the clearest sign yet of mounting concern in the Chinese government and corporate sector that the country\u2019s economy is stalling.", "The interest rate cut was small \u2014 a tenth of a percentage point for the country\u2019s benchmark one-year and five-year interest rates for loans.
