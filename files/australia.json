Nihohae\u2019s protruding teeth were deeply rooted in its skull, which limited their ability to continue growing over the animal\u2019s lifetime. As a result, Nihohae\u2019s teeth are more similar to the tusklike projections on the lower jaws of male beaked whales, which use these teeth to tussle over females.", "To determine how Nihohae wielded its tusklike teeth, Dr. Coste and her colleagues examined several of the teeth under a scanning electron microscope. Surprisingly, the researchers found little evidence of wear on them.", "This meant it was unlikely that Nihohae used its tusklike teeth to fight rivals for mates. It also cast doubt on another hypothesis that Nihohae used its teeth to sift through the sandy seafloor for prey. \u201cSand is really abrasive and will absolutely trash your teeth, but there\u2019s literally no scratches on these teeth,\u201d Dr. Coste said.", "The teeth\u2019s horizontal orientation also made them a poor tool for snagging prey. While the teeth of other fossil dolphins interlocked to trap fish inside, Nihohae\u2019s splayed-out teeth would not have been useful for that task. They were also nearly flat, so Nihohae would have had a tough time biting into anything.", "Because no other dolphin possessed teeth like Nihohae\u2019s, the researchers scoured the rest of the animal kingdom for similar anatomy. This led them to sawfish, which swipe their tooth-studded saws to either injure or stun prey before vacuuming it up whole.", "Dr. Coste and her colleagues hypothesize that Nihohae, whose unfused vertebrae probably allowed for a broad range of neck movement, hunted in a similar way, swinging its head to skewer or stun squid and other soft-bodied sea creatures. Then it would swallow the staggered prey whole.", "\u201cYou can just imagine these dolphins swimming up to a shoal of squid and wildly thrashing their heads back and forth,\u201d Dr. Coste said.", "This hunting style seems plausible, according to Robert Boessenecker, a paleontologist at the College of Charleston in South Carolina who was not involved in the new study.", "\u201cGiven that the teeth in Nihohae are splayed out to the side, that\u2019s pretty good indication that there was lateral movement similar to the sweeping of a sawfish snout,\u201d said Dr. Boessenecker, who has studied other toothy dolphin fossils from both South Carolina and New Zealand.", "Dr. Coste hopes that further examination of Nihohae\u2019s tusklike teeth and future fossil finds will shed additional light on the diversity of ancient dolphin hunting techniques."]}, {"australia_5": ["New Zealand\u2019s public radio broadcaster has found that nearly two dozen articles by Reuters and the BBC that it had republished on its website had been edited inappropriately, with some of them given a pro-Russian slant, according to a spokesman for the broadcaster.", "The broadcaster, Radio New Zealand, said on Friday that it would investigate articles it found that contained problems.

The paleontological community \u201ccollectively assumed that dinosaurs were really, really hard to find in Australia,\u201d he added.", "That all changed, according to scientists,\u00a0when David Elliott, a farmer near Winton, came across some fossils on his farm in 1999.", "It was not unusual for residents in Central West Queensland to stumble upon ancient remains. Mr. Elliott, 66, recalled how his father would often come home after a day\u2019s work on the family farm with his pockets bulging with fossils. Once he took over the farm, he also kept one eye on the ground while mustering his sheep and eventually collected enough fragments to cover a pingpong table.", "But locals largely kept their findings to themselves, fearing that publicizing them would bring a flood of scientists, bureaucracy and red tape into their lives.", "When Mr. Elliott decided to contact a paleontologist two years later, \u201cEveryone said, \u2018Oh, mate, they\u2019ll build a national park and take you over,\u2019\u201d he recalled, adding: \u201cWe were very much a test case for the region. No one else was putting their hand up.\u201d\u00a0", "It was lucky he did, as the resulting excavation upended paleontologists\u2019 understanding of how to find dinosaur fossils in Australia.", "Earlier paleontologists had assumed that small fragments like those found by Mr. Elliott were the last remains of complete fossils that had been weathered down\u00a0into nearly nothing over the ages, and now had little scientific value.", "Mr. Elliott thought differently. Having lived and worked on the land all his life, he knew that parts of things deep underground could often be seen on the surface. He believed that the fragments could be markers pointing the way to dinosaur graveyards far below the surface.", "When the scientists arrived on his property, he got his excavator and started to dig. His suspicions were confirmed: About five feet down, the earth was teeming with chunks of bone.", "\u201cThat really is the watershed point,\u201d said Scott Hocknull, a paleontologist at the Queensland Museum, who was there.

Paleontologists started using the same method to unearth more bones around the region, including of one of the largest dinosaurs in the world.", "A paleo-tourism industry quickly emerged. Paleontologists who once left the country, believing that the only way to advance their careers was overseas, flocked back. Dinosaur excavations were organized, where volunteers exhumed dozens of bones at a time.
